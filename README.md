Global Crisis Impact on Business & Workforce
Data Science & Analytics Project
 Overview

Economic crises significantly impact business stability and workforce planning.
This project analyses the relationship between macroeconomic inflation trends and workforce layoffs, using real-world datasets to generate actionable insights for business leaders and policymakers.

By combining economic indicators with layoff data, the project demonstrates how data-driven decision-making can support organisations during periods of uncertainty.

 Project Objectives

Analyse historical workforce layoff trends

Study the impact of inflation on workforce risk

Apply data science techniques to real-world economic problems

Translate analytical results into business insights

 Business Context

During periods of high inflation, organisations often face:

Increased operating costs

Reduced consumer demand

Pressure to optimise workforce size

Understanding these relationships helps leaders make proactive workforce planning decisions rather than reactive layoffs.

Datasets Used

Layoffs Dataset
Real-world data capturing workforce layoffs across companies and industries over multiple years.

Inflation Dataset
Macroeconomic inflation data aggregated at a yearly level.

Both datasets were cleaned, standardised, and aggregated to ensure analytical consistency.

Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas & NumPy – Data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualisation

Scikit-learn – Machine learning (Logistic Regression)

Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

 Methodology

Data loading and quality checks

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Feature engineering and aggregation

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Predictive modelling using Logistic Regression

Model interpretation for business understanding

Key Insights

Periods of higher inflation are associated with an increased risk of workforce layoffs

Inflation can act as an early warning indicator for workforce planning

Simple, interpretable models can provide valuable business insights

Combining economic data with workforce analytics enhances strategic decision-making

 Model Interpretation

The Logistic Regression coefficient analysis shows the directional impact of inflation on layoff risk, making the results easily interpretable for non-technical stakeholders.

 Limitations

Limited macroeconomic variables (inflation only)

Historical data dependency

Does not capture sudden external shocks in real time

Future Scope

Include additional economic indicators (GDP, interest rates)

Industry-level and company-level modelling

Time-series forecasting for proactive risk assessment

Advanced machine learning models for improved accuracy
