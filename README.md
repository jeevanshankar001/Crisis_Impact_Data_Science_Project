# Global Crisis Impact on Workforce Layoffs  
### A Data Science & Analytics Project

## Project Overview
This project analyses the relationship between global economic crises—specifically inflation trends—and workforce layoffs across industries. The objective is to understand whether macroeconomic indicators such as inflation can be used to assess layoff risk and workforce instability.

The project combines data science techniques with business and economic insights, aligning with real-world decision-making used by organisations, policymakers, and strategic leaders.

This work reflects my academic background in **Data Science & Analytics** and my **UK MBA**, with a focus on evidence-based management and analytics-driven strategy.

## Problem Statement
Global economic crises significantly affect organisations and employees, yet many workforce decisions are reactive rather than data-driven.

This project aims to answer:
- How does inflation correlate with large-scale workforce layoffs?
- Can inflation trends be used as an early indicator of high layoff risk?
- What insights can organisations derive to support strategic workforce planning?

## Data Sources
The project uses two primary datasets:

1. **Layoffs Dataset**
   - Company-level layoff information
   - Industry classification
   - Date and scale of layoffs

2. **Inflation Dataset**
   - Year-wise inflation rates
   - Macroeconomic indicators representing economic stress

Datasets were cleaned, standardised, and merged to enable meaningful analysis.

## Methodology
The project follows a structured data science workflow:

1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Feature engineering and aggregation
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. Statistical analysis
6. Predictive modelling using Logistic Regression
7. Model interpretation and business insights

## Key Techniques and Tools
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Logistic Regression
- Data Visualisation
- Model Interpretation
